            <div>
              10.1. This Agreement constitutes a contract between the User and the Society regarding
              the use of the service and supersedes all previous agreements between the User and the
              Society.<br></br>
              10.2. This Agreement is governed and interpreted in accordance with the legislation of
              the Republic of Tajikistan. Matters not regulated by this Agreement are subject to
              resolution in accordance with the legislation of the Republic of Tajikistan. All
              possible disputes arising from the relations regulated by this Agreement are resolved
              in accordance with the laws of Tajikistan. Throughout the text of this Agreement,
              unless explicitly stated otherwise, the term "legislation" is understood as the
              legislation of the Republic of Tajikistan, as well as the legislation of the User's
              place of residence.<br></br>
              10.3. Nothing in the Agreement can be construed as establishing between the User and
              the Society agency relations, partnership relations, joint activity relations,
              personal hiring relations, or any other relations not expressly provided for in the
              Agreement.<br></br>
              10.4. If, for any reason, one or more provisions of this Agreement are found to be
              invalid or unenforceable, this does not affect the validity or applicability of the
              remaining provisions of the Agreement.<br></br>
              10.5. The inaction of the Society in the event of a User's or other users' violation
              of the Agreement's provisions does not deprive the Society of the right to take
              appropriate actions to protect its interests later, nor does it mean the Society's
              waiver of its rights in the event of similar or identical violations in the future.
              <br></br>
              10.6. This Agreement is drawn up in Tajik and Russian languages and, if necessary, can
              be provided to the User for review in another language. In case of discrepancies
              between the Tajik-language version of the Agreement and the version of the Agreement
              in another language, the provisions of the Tajik-language version of this Agreement
              apply.
